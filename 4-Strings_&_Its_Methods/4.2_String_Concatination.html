    # String Concatination Using + Operator:
        - It Useful For Performing Basic String Concatination.
        - But It Become Less Readable When Performingg More Complex Concatinations.

        Eg:
            <script>
                let greet = "Hello";
                let name = "Gaurav";

                let result = greet + " " + name;

                console.log(result);
            </script>

        O/p:
            Hello Gaurav

    # String Concatination Using += Operator:
        - It Is Useful When We Want To Add A String To An Existing String & Modify The Original String.
        
        Eg:
            <script>
                let userName = "Gaurav ";
                userName += "Dev";
                console.log(userName);
            </script>

    # String Concatination Using Template Literals:
        - Template Literals Use Backticks (`) To Enclose A String Insted Of Single Or Double Quotes.
        - Inside The Backticks, we Insert A Variable Or Expressions Directly Into String Using ${}.
        - It Provide A Readable & Concise Syntex.

        Eg:
            <script>
                let username = "Sky_Dev";
                let accessId = 7;
                let authenticate = `The Employee ${username} Has Been Accessed ${accessId} Data`;
                console.log(authenticate);
            </script>

        O/p:
            The Employee Sky_Dev Has Been Accessed 7 Data


    # Using concat() Method:
        - concat() Method Is A Build Is Method.
        - It Is Used To Concatinate Two Or More Strings.
        - It Is Useful When We Want To Concatinate String But Don't Want To Modify Existing Strings.

        Eg:
            <script>
                let str1 = "Hello ";
                let str2 = "Dev";
                let res = str1.concat(str2);
                console.log(res);
            </script>

        O/p:
            Hello Dev

    # Using join() Method:
        - join() Method Is A Build In Method.
        - It Is Used When We Working On Arrays Of String.
        - It Combines All Array Elements Into A Single String & Seperated By A Seperator.If Seperator Is Not Defined A Comma (,) Is Used Default.
        
        Eg:
            <script>
                let programmingLang = ["JavaScript","Java","Python"];
                let output = programmingLang.join(" ")
            </script>
