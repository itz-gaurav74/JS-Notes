    # For Loop:
        - It Allows You To Repeat Some Code A Specified Number OF Times.

        Syntax:
            
            for ( initial command; termination condition; commands after iteration){
                loop body
            }

        <!-- - Initial Commands Are What Will Be Executed Before The Start Of The Loop. It Will Be Executed Only Once. Eg: i = 0;

        - The Condition Of The Loop Termination Is A Condition Under Which The Loop Will Spin, While It Is True. Eg: i <= 10;

        - Commands After The Loop Iteration Mean Counters are Increased There. Eg: i++; -->

        Example: Use The For Loop To Print Numbers From 1 To 9 ?
            <script>
                for(let i = 1; i <=9; i++){
                    console.log(i);
                }
            </script>
