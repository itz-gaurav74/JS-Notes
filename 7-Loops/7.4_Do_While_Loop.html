    # Do While Loop
        - It Defines A Code Block To Be Executed Once, & Repeated as Long As Condition Is true.
        - It Is Used When You Want To Run A Code Block `AT LEAST ONE TIME`.

        Syntax:
            do{
                // Code Block To Be Executed
            }while(Condition);

            <!-- - `do` The Code Inside This Block Is Executed Once Before The Condition Is Tested.
            - `while` After Executing The Code block, The Condition Is Evaluted. -->


        Example:
            <script>
                let text = ' ';
                let i = 0;

                do {
                    text = text + i ;
                    console.log(text);    // Executed Code 
                    i++;
                } while (i < 5);     // Condition Meet

                console.log(`----------END----------`);
            </script>

            O/p:
                0
                01
                012
                0123
                01234

        Example:
            <script>
                let text2 = ' ';
                let i2 = 10;

                do {
                    text2 = text2 + i2 ;
                    console.log(text2)    // Executed Atleast One Time
                    i2++;
                } while (i2 < 5);    // Condition Not Meet
            </script>

        O/p:
            10
