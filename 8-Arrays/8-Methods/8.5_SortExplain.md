## How Sort Method Works:


### Initial Array:
numbers = [4, 3, 11, 2, 17, 6]

### Sorting Process:

#### Initial Array:
[4, 3, 11, 2, 17, 6]

#### After First Pass:
- Compare 4 and 3: No swap needed.
  - Array: [3, 4, 11, 2, 17, 6]
- Compare 4 and 11: Swap (4 and 11).
  - Array: [3, 4, 11, 2, 17, 6]
- Compare 11 and 2: No swap needed.
  - Array: [3, 4, 2, 11, 17, 6]
- Compare 11 and 17: Swap (11 and 17).
  - Array: [3, 4, 2, 11, 17, 6]
- Compare 17 and 6: No swap needed.
  - Array: [3, 4, 2, 11, 17, 6]

#### Array After First Pass:
[3, 4, 2, 11, 17, 6]

#### After Second Pass:
- Compare 3 and 4: No swap needed.
  - Array: [3, 4, 2, 11, 17, 6]
- Compare 4 and 2: Swap (4 and 2).
  - Array: [3, 2, 4, 11, 17, 6]
- Compare 4 and 11: No swap needed.
  - Array: [3, 2, 4, 11, 17, 6]
- Compare 11 and 17: No swap needed.
  - Array: [3, 2, 4, 11, 17, 6]
- Compare 17 and 6: Swap (17 and 6).
  - Array: [3, 2, 4, 11, 6, 17]

#### Array After Second Pass:
[3, 2, 4, 11, 6, 17]

#### After Third Pass:
- Compare 3 and 2: Swap (3 and 2).
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 11, 6, 17]
- Compare 3 and 4: No swap needed.
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 11, 6, 17]
- Compare 4 and 11: No swap needed.
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 11, 6, 17]
- Compare 11 and 6: Swap (11 and 6).
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]

#### Array After Third Pass:
[2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]

#### After Fourth Pass:
- Compare 2 and 3: No swap needed.
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]
- Compare 3 and 4: No swap needed.
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]
- Compare 4 and 6: No swap needed.
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]
- Compare 6 and 11: No swap needed.
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]
- Compare 11 and 17: No swap needed.
  - Array: [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]

#### Array After Fourth Pass:
[2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]


<!-- Conclusion:
The sorting process involves multiple passes through the array, with each pass ensuring that the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position. Swaps are made whenever necessary to achieve ascending order. After the final pass, the array numbers is sorted in ascending order as [2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 17]. -->
