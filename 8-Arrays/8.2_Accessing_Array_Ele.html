    # Accessing Array Ele:
        - It Is Similay To Accessing The Characters Of A String.
        - each Ele Of An Array Has Its Own Index.
            - First Ele Has Index 0.
            - Second Ele Has Index 2, & So On...
        - This Indices Called Keys Of Array Elements.

        Example:
            <script>
                let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
                console.log(arr[0]);
                console.log(arr[1]);
                console.log(arr[2]);
            </script>

            O/p:
                a
                b
                c

        Example:
        <!-- Q-1 Create An Array With Ele 1,2,3 & Display The Sum Of Ele Of This Array On Console ? -->

            <script>
                let arrEle = [1,2,3];
                let total = arrEle[0]+arrEle[1]+arrEle[2]
                    console.log(`The Sum Of All Elements In Array Is : ${total}`);
            </script>

            O/p:
                The Sum Of All Elements In Array Is : 6
