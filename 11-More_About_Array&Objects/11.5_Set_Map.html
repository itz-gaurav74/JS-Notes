    # Set Vs Map:

        Note:
            Both 'Set' and 'Map' are useful data structures in JavaScript that allow you to manage collections of data in a variety of ways. 'Set' is ideal when you need to store unique values, while 'Map' is useful for associating keys with values.


        Summary:
            * Use a 'Set' when you need a collection of unique items and don't need to associate keys with values.
            * Use a 'Map' when you need to store key-value pairs with keys that can be of any type and maintain their insertion order.
