    # Sets:
        - Sets Are Iterable.
        - It Stores Data.
        - Sets Can Store Only Unique Values (Can't Store Duplicates).
        - No Index-Based Access.
        - Sets Have Its Own Methods.
        - It Sore Data In Un-Ordered Way.


        Example:
            <script>
                let nums = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]);

                console.log(`The type Of Set Is : ${typeof nums}`);
                console.log('Duplicates Are Not Allowed ', nums);
                console.log( "We Can't Access Index-Based Ele Of Sets Shows :", nums[2]);
            </script>

            O/p:
                The type Of Set Is : object
                Duplicates Are Not Allowed  Set(4)Â {1, 2, 3, 4}
                We Can't Access Index-Based Ele Of Sets Shows : undefined

            - Passing an array to new Set().
            - Create an empty set and use add() to add values.
