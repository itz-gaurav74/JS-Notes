###  As A Given Arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]   & Arr2 = [2, 5, 6, 1] Find The Duplicate Ele In Array & Unique Ele In Array ?

1. Combining Arrays:
    ```
    let combined = [...a, ...b];
    
    ```
    > The spread operator merges arrays `a` and `b` into one array.

2. Tracking seen/emptyArr Elements:
    ```
    const emptyArr = new Set();
    
    ```
    >  This `Set` keeps track of elements that have been encountered.
    >> * `seen/emptyArr` is another `Set` that keeps track of elements that have been encountered in the array so far. This helps us determine whether an element is a duplicate.

3.  Identifying Duplicates:
    ```
    const duplicates = new Set();

    for(const element of combinedArr){
        if (emptyArr.has(element)) {
            duplicates.add(element);
        } else {
            emptyArr.add(element);
        }
    }
    
    ```
    ```
    const duplicates = new Set();
    
    ```

    > `duplicates` is a `Set` that will store elements that appear more than once across the combined array. A Set is used here because it only keeps unique values, which makes it ideal for collecting unique duplicate elements.
    
     ```
    for (let element of combinedArr) {
    
    ```
    
    > This loop iterates over each element in the combined array. The combined array is formed by merging arrays `a` and `b`.
    
     >> ```
    if (emptyArr.has(element)) {
    
    
     >> `emptyArr.has(element)` checks if the current `element` is already in the `emptyArr` set.
    >>> If true, it means this element has been encountered before, so it's a duplicate.
    >>> ```
    duplicates.add(ele);
    
    >>>  Since the `element` is already in the `emptyArr` set, it is added to the `duplicates` set. This ensures that only the unique duplicates are stored in the `duplicates` set.
    
    >>> ```
    else {
        seen.add(element);
    }
    
    >>> * If element is not in the seen set, it means this is the first time the element is encountered.
    >>> * seen.add(element) adds the element to the seen set to track it for future encounters.
    
    
#### Example:

* Letâ€™s use a concrete example to illustrate how the code works:
* Assume combined is [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1].


# Detailed Iteration
### Process each element in the combined array as follows:

1. First Iteration: `element = 1`

    - `emptyArr` is `{}`, `duplicates` is `{}`.
    - `1` is not in `emptyArr`, so add `1` to `emptyArr`.
    - `emptyArr` becomes `{1}`.
    
2. Second Iteration: `element = 2`

    - `2` is not in `emptyArr`, so add `2` to `emptyArr`.
    - `emptyArr` becomes `{1, 2}`.

3. Third Iteration: `element = 4`

    - `4` is not in `emptyArr`, so add `4` to `emptyArr`.
    - `emptyArr` becomes `{1, 2, 4}`.

4. Fourth Iteration: `element = 7`

    - `7` is not in `emptyArr`, so add `7` to `emptyArr`.
    - `emptyArr` becomes `{1, 2, 4, 7}`.

5. Fifth Iteration: `element = 5`

    - `5` is not in `emptyArr`, so add `5` to `emptyArr`.
    - `emptyArr` becomes `{1, 2, 4, 5, 7`}.

6. Sixth Iteration: `element = 8`

    - `8` is not in `emptyArr`, so add `8` to `emptyArr`.
    - `emptyArr` becomes `{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}`.

7. Seventh Iteration: `element = 7`

    - `7` is already in `emptyArr`, so add `7` to `duplicates`.
    - `duplicates` becomes `{7}`.

8. Eighth Iteration: `element = 1`

    - `1` is already in `emptyArr`, so add `1` to `duplicates`.
    - `duplicates` becomes `{1, 7}`.

9. Ninth Iteration: `element = 4`

    - `4` is already in `emptyArr`, so add `4` to `duplicates`.
    - `duplicates` becomes `{1, 4, 7}`.
    
10. Further Iterations

    Continue in a similar manner for the remaining elements. Each time an element is found in `emptyArr`, it is added to `duplicates`.


    ### Result
    
    The duplicates set will contain all unique elements that appear more than once in the `combined` array. For this example, `duplicates` will be `{1, 4, 7}`.
