    <title>Primitive Vs Refrence Data Type</title>
</head>
<body>
    # Primitive Data Type:
        - Are Store Data On Stack Memory.
        - Primitive Data Are Stored Directly In A Variable.
        - number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol.
        - When We Assign A Primitive VAlue To A Variable, A Copy Of That Value Is Created & Stored In Memory. Any Changes Made To The Variable Do Not Affect The Original Value.

        Example:
            <script>
                let x = 5;
                let y = x;

                x = 10;
                console.log(x);
                console.log(y);
            </script>

            O/p:
                10
                5


    
    # Refrence Data Type:
        - Are Store Data On Heap Memory.
        - Refrence Data Values Are Stored In Memory & Accessed Through A Refrence.
        - array, object, functions.
        - When We Assign A Refrence Value To A Variable, A Refrence To The Original Value Is Created & Stored In Memory. Any Changes MAde To The Variable Affect The Original Value.
        - Use Const For Better Understanding

        Example:
            <script>
                let arr = [1, 2, 3];
                let arr2 = arr;

                arr.push(4);
                console.log(arr);
                console.log(arr2);
            </script>

            O/p:
                [1, 2, 3, 4]
                [1, 2, 3, 4]
