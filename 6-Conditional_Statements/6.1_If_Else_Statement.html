    # If Else:
        - It Allows Some Code To Be Executed Depending On Some Condition.

        Syntax:
            <script>
                if (condition_operation) {
                    // the code written here will be executed if the result of the condition_operation is true
                } else {
                    // the code located here will be executed if the result of the condition_operation is incorrect
                }
            </script>

            <script>
                let age = 22;
                if (age > 18) {
                    console.log('User Is Authenticated');
                } else {
                    console.log('User Access Denied');
                }
